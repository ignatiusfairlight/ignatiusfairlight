## Hi there 👋
I am Bryan, but I go by Ignatius Fairlight, my online alias. I am a freelance web developer(or fullstack developer, honestly I'm not sure myself).

I use Sveltekit and its libraries (e.g ShadCN-Svelte) for frontend project and Supabase as the backend.

Currently, I'm learning Laravel to create customizable backend for future projects/commissions.

- Sveltekit
- Supabase
