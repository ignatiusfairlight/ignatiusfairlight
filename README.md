**Hi there** 👋<br>

I am Bryan, but I go by Ignatius Fairlight, my online alias. 

I am a freelance web developer(or fullstack developer, honestly I'm not sure myself), based in Malaysia.

I use Sveltekit and its libraries (e.g ShadCN-Svelte) for frontend projects and Supabase as its backend.

Currently, I'm learning Laravel to create customizable backend for future projects/commissions.
